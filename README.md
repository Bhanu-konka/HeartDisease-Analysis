# HeartDisease-Analysis
Exploratory Data analysis
❤️ Heart Disease Dataset Analysis (EDA Only)
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Heart Disease Dataset. The goal is to understand the data, identify key patterns, visualize relationships among variables, and highlight factors that may influence the presence of heart disease.

📂 Dataset

Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository – Heart Disease Dataset

Key Attributes:

Age

Sex

Chest Pain Type

Resting Blood Pressure

Serum Cholesterol

Fasting Blood Sugar

Resting ECG Results

Maximum Heart Rate Achieved

Exercise-Induced Angina

ST Depression & Slope

Number of Major Vessels (0–3)

Thalassemia

Target (0 = No Heart Disease, 1 = Heart Disease)

⚙️ Steps in the Analysis

Data Loading – Imported dataset using Pandas.

Data Cleaning – Checked missing values, handled inconsistencies, verified data types.

Univariate Analysis – Distribution of Age, Gender, Cholesterol, BP, etc.

Bivariate Analysis – Compared features with Target variable (e.g., Heart Disease vs. Age group).

Correlation Analysis – Used heatmaps to identify relationships among numerical variables.

Visualization – Created plots (bar charts, histograms, boxplots, countplots, heatmaps) using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Key Insights – Highlighted which factors show strong patterns with the target variable.

📊 Insights Gained

Certain age groups show higher risk of heart disease.

Males had higher representation in patients with heart disease.

Chest pain type and maximum heart rate are strong indicators.

Cholesterol and resting BP show noticeable patterns in risk levels.

🚀 Future Scope

Extend analysis with predictive modeling (Logistic Regression, Random Forest).

Build an interactive dashboard for visualization (Streamlit/Power BI).

Perform feature importance ranking for better understanding.
